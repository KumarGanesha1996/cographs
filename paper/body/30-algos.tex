\chapter{Implemented cograph algorithms}\label{r:algos}

In this chapter we will describe the algorithms implemented to solve known graph problems on cographs efficiently. Cotrees produced by the \cite{corneil} algorithm are used as an input into these algorithms.

Implemented are four algorithms which are NP-hard in general case, but can be solved linearly in case of cographs. These algorithms are: minimal path cover, optimal coloring, finding maximal clique, finding minimal independent set. Last three algorithms follow a very similar pattern of combining recursively results from subcotrees. In case of minimal path cover, implementation described in \cite{olariu}. It is worth mentioning that deciding whether cograph is Hamiltonian (which may be seen as a decision version of minimal path cover problem) can also be done in vein similar to the other algorithms as described in \cite{corneil2}.
