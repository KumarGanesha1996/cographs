\chapter{Implemented cograph recognition algorithms}\label{r:coid}

In this chapter we will describe the algorithms implemented in order to recognize the cographs.

First cograph recognition algorithm is implemented from \cite{habib}. It produces factorizing permutation if input graph is a cograph and some incorrect permutation otherwise. Algorithm checking whether the permutation is factorizing is then run in order to differentiate between cographs and non-cographs.

Second cograph recognition is implemented from \cite{corneil}. It produces cotree and halts if it is not possible.
