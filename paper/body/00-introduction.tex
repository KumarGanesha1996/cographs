Cographs are a special kind of graphs which can be obtained through repeated application of and disjoint union and joint union to a single vertex graph. Several algorithms can be computed efficiently in case of cographs even if no general case algorithm is known.

This paper presents implementation of two algorithms that check whether the input graph is a cograph. The first one is from \cite{habib} and the second one is from \cite{corneil}. The second algorithm generates a cotree of a graph which is then used in order to efficiently implement algorithms for maximum clique, maximum independent set, minimum path cover and optimal graph coloring.

Chapter \ref{r:pre} defines necessary concepts used in this paper and shows some properties of cographs. Chapter \ref{r:coid} presents algorithms used to identify cographs. Chapter \ref{r:algos} describes implemented cotree algorithms and proves their correctness. Chapter \ref{r:experiments} presents empirical execution times for all implemented algorithms. Implementations of aforementioned algorithms and source for this paper can be found here: \url{https://github.com/marcin-serwin/cographs}.
